# README.md Generator
This project was built with NodeJS in order to quickly generate README's for future projects; 

## Installation
In order to install and run this application you must have NPM libraries "fs" and "inquirer".

## Usage
Running this application is fairly simple, first navigate to the location of the files with a terminal, type `node index.js`, then simply follow the prompts to generate a README.md file.
