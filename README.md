# README.md Generator
This project was built with NodeJS in order to quickly generate README's for future projects; 

## Installation
In order to install and run this application you must have NPM libraries "fs" and "inquirer".

## Usage
Running this application is fairly simple, first navigate to the location of the files with a terminal, type `node index.js`, then simply follow the prompts to generate a README.md file.

## Questions
For additional information you can reach out at the GitHub account "NikolasMazur".

## To-do
Due to poor planning (again) and time constraints the dashboard is missing three minor, yet still important, aspects of the planned site. Those being local storage for previous searches, general styling for the page, and undefined UV Index numbers.
